        <h2> One of the greatest chicken soup experiences known to man. </h2>
        <p> If there were a Mount Rushmore for chicken soups, this is on it. Although, I’m guessing carving a bowl of soup into a rock mountain face would be a lot tougher than a face. Anyway, the point is, this is a really good soup. </p>
        <p>I hope you find the time to make it from scratch, but if you don’t, you’ll still be able to experience most of the awesomeness. If you use some high-quality chicken broth, and find some not-terribly-dry cooked chicken, you should be in decent shape. We’ll even let you break up some store-bought tortilla chips to finish the soup if you have to, but it’s so much better if you make your own crispy noodle-like strips. </p>
        <p>Either way, this is a bucket-list chicken soup, and I really do hope you give it a try soon. Enjoy!  </p>
        <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 (4 1/2 pound) whole chicken </li>
            <li> 3 white onions, halved, divided</li>
            <li> 1 bunch cilantro, rinsed well </li>
            <li> 2 bay leaves </li>
            <li> 1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns</li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon Mexican oregano</li>
            <li> 2 dried chili pepper pods, seeded (optional) </li>
            <li> 3 quarts water </li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Steps </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>  Combine chicken, 1 onion, stems from the cilantro bunch, bay leaves, oregano, peppercorns, dried chili pods, and 3 quarts of water in a large soup pot set over medium-high heat. Bring to simmer, lower heat to medium-low, and simmer for 1 hour. </li>
            <li>  Meanwhile, make the tortilla strips: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper. </li>
            <li>  Cut tortillas in half, and then cut crosswise into 1/4-inch strips. Transfer tortilla strips to the prepared baking sheet and drizzle with oil. Add salt and toss well to coat, then spread strips out as evenly as possible. </li>
            <li>  Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and crispy, tossing once or twice during the cooking time, about 30 minutes. Set aside. </li>
            <li>  Carefully remove chicken to a bowl. Reduce heat on broth to low. </li>
            <li>  Let chicken rest until cool enough to pull off the meat. Shred chicken and refrigerate until needed. </li>
            <li>  Add bones, skin, and all the scraps back to the pot of broth, and simmer on low heat for about 4 hours total. If broth reduces too much, just add a splash of water. </li>
            <li>  Meanwhile, after about 2 hours, make the charred vegetable salsa: Preheat on the oven’s broiler for high heat and set a rack about 8 inches below the heating element. Line a baking sheet with foil and oil lightly; place remaining 2 onions, tomatoes, sweet red pepper, and jalapeno pepper on the prepared baking sheet. </li>
            <li> ... and so on</li>
        </ol>
