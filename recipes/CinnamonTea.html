    <h2> Warm and comforting tea </h2>
    <p>  I make this cinnamon tea every now and then, when I pull out the German china tea set my mother-in-law brought home from one of her trips. It makes me feel special, and I can take pleasure in remembering her as I savor each sip. I like cinnamon stick tea in the afternoon, because itâ€™s warm and comforting, and there is no caffeine! Try it with a lemon slice, and a drizzle of honey, or use whatever sweetener you prefer.</p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>6 (4-inch) cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li> 4 lemon slices, or as needed</li>
        <li> 4 teaspoons honey, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol> 
        <li>  Bring water and cinnamon sticks to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer for about 5 minutes. </li>
